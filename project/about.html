   <h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction To Nursery</h3><br>
  <p>A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to a desired age for transplanting in main fields or for sale.
A nursery is the place where young plants are raised and taken care of until they reach the right size for transplanting.
It includes retail nurseries which sell their plants to the general public, while the wholesale nurseries which sell the plant
only to businesses such as other nurseries and to commercial gardens, and private nurseries which supply the needs of institutions 
or private estates.Vegetable growers, floriculturists,foresters, orchardists and various plant growers largely depends on the availability
of nursery plants in nearby market but such plants may be raised without much care and less attention given towards genetic purity. 
The main aim of the nursery owner is to earn profit and hence the plant material raised is mostly of average quality. Many growers and producers 
have gained awareness about quality and it has opened the field of nursery management for profit and production of quality plants.
Nursery management includes raising and selling of nursery plants which is an art and a skill. It needs experience, practice, foresight
and technical knowledge about nurseries. Nurseries may supply plants for raising gardens, for planting in agriculture fields,for forest purposes 
and for conservational biology.</p>

    <h2>Medicinal And Ayurvedic Plants</h2><br>
   <p>Medicinal plants occupy a central role in Indian traditional medicine, particularly within the Ayurvedic system. Ayurveda, meaning “the science of life,” integrates natural 
    remedies to support health, balance, and longevity. Medicinal plants are highly valued for their therapeutic properties and are fundamental to this holistic approach.
    In Ayurveda, these plants are utilized in various forms, including fresh, dried, powdered, and as extracts, to address a wide range of health issues. They are recognized for
    their diverse effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and restorative benefits, making them essential in both preventive care and treatment.</p>

    <h3>Various Types Of Frits Plants</h3><br>
    <p>Fruit plants can be classified into different types based on how their fruits are formed, their lifespan, and their growth habits. Based on the way fruits develop, 
      there are three main types. Simple fruit plants produce fruits from a single ovary of one flower; examples include mango, tomato, guava, and apple. Aggregate fruit
      plants bear fruits that develop from multiple ovaries of a single flower, like strawberry, raspberry, and custard apple. Multiple fruit plants, also called composite 
      fruit plants, form fruits from a group of flowers (inflorescence); pineapple, jackfruit, and fig are examples of this type.
      Based on their lifespan, fruit plants can be classified as annual, biennial, or perennial. Annual fruit plants complete their life cycle in one season and include 
      examples like watermelon and melon. Biennial fruit plants live for two growing seasons but are rare among fruit-bearing plants. Most commonly, perennial fruit plants 
      live and produce fruits for many years—mango, banana, apple, and orange are typical examples.
      According to their growth habits, fruit plants can be trees, shrubs, herbs, or climbers. Tree fruits grow on large woody plants like mango, apple, and jamun. Shrub fruits
      grow on shorter bushy plants such as gooseberry and blueberry. Some fruits grow on herbaceous plants with soft stems, like banana and papaya. Lastly, some fruit plants are
      climbers or vines, which require support to grow, such as grapes, watermelon, and passionfruit.
      This classification helps in understanding how different fruit plants grow, develop, and bear fruits in diverse ways.</p>

    food source, with almost 1,100 different kinds of vegetables recognized in the world. Some can be eaten raw in salads, while others are used to cook the most delicious dishes.
